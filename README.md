# hello-world
My first repository!
Got into coding a few years ago, mostly as part of my interest in videogames. Studied Python, as well as a music-oriented language called Chuck, and also learned a lot about how to work with the game engine Gamemaker. Now I'm beginning the process of building a career as a programmer, with the goal of becoming a web developer.
